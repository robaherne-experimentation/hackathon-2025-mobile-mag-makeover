                    "content": "Whether you're treating yourself to the latest laptop or replacing a temperamental tumble dryer, how do you know which shop to choose? Everyone wants a good price, but not at the expense of a shonky product, rude staff, dodgy deliveries or a guarantee barely worth the paper it's printed on.\n\nWe've quizzed thousands of shoppers about their experiences of buying tech and home appliances to bring you the definitive guide on where to buy.\n\nRicher Sounds is top for tech, while Samsung leads the pack for the first time for appliances. Shoppers love everything about these two retailers, from their excellent value for money to their fantastic after-sales service.\n\nMeanwhile, at the bottom of the pile are Sainsbury's for tech purchases, and The Range and Wickes for appliances.\n\nHere, we unpick the real story behind thousands of purchases to reveal the retailers you love the most. We also unveil a string of new Which? Recommended Providers (WRPs). Only the best of the best qualify – retailers need to meet strict criteria, including at least four stars for after-sales and customer service, plus a clear and legally compliant returns policy."

Shoppers value its great reputation and reliable service, with many people saying the top-quality products and excellent customer service are what draws them to John Lewis.\n\nIt's been a big year for the retailer, with a new chairman (ex-Tesco boss Jason Tarry) and a decision to bring back its 'never knowingly undersold' price promise. But losses in the first half of the year nearly tripled, despite a 4% rise in sales, after restructuring costs and new tax and regulatory charges. One shopper said: 'I can always trust John Lewis – it is usually very fair with its customers. The quality of what it sells is good, and there's usually a good choice whatever I'm buying.' Customers also like the after-sales care it offers. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that John Lewis is a WRP for both tech purchases and home appliance products."

It does well in both our league tables, being named a WRP for both, and is particularly highly regarded for its huge range of products. Shoppers also love its fast delivery and efficient website. One shopper explained: 'The whole process was easy and smooth. The website was clear, the prices were fair and the delivery was fast. The appliances arrived in great condition, and the customer service was helpful. I would definitely use the company again.'\n\nSome customers picked out its loyalty scheme for special mention – for £39.99 a year, you get free and unlimited delivery, free unpacking and removal of your old appliance, plus member-only savings. Some said it paid for itself, while others saw it as a potential subscription trap, particularly if you forget to cancel it."

One said: 'It offers quality goods by pleasant helpful staff in a local store. A lovely place to browse.' Earlier this year, Lakeland underwent a management buyout funded by Hilco Capital, former owner of HMV and Homebase."

Another added: 'Its selection isn't huge, but its speed of delivery is good and you know there will be no problems if you need to return an item.' It performs so well, and has such good returns policies, that we've made it a WRP."

The American tech firm gets the highest possible ratings for every aspect of the shopping experience apart from value, for which it gets three stars out of five. 'Great product and service… but very expensive,' was how one shopper summed it up.\n\nCustomers still love Apple, though, with many telling us how trustworthy and reliable it is. Many said they were repeat customers, always going back to Apple for their next tech purchase. One told us: 'I have used Apple for multiple years and its products have always exceeded my expectations. The quality is also excellent; despite paying extra for products, you definitely get your money's worth eventually.' Apple opened its first UK store 20 years ago and now has 40 across the country, including a flagship store in London's Regent Street."

Quite a few told us they find it convenient and good value but aren't huge fans of some of some parts of its business model.\n\nSome people mentioned its effects on the high street, while others said they didn't trust Amazon reviews or the constant push for Prime sign-ups. Several shoppers described the Amazon website as having 'good products mixed up with a load of rubbish'. One customer explained: 'I buy from Amazon, but I really don't like it. I don't like what it has done to the rest of the market and I don't like its way of dealing with customers.'"
